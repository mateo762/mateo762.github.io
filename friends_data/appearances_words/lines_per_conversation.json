Good night."], "c11": ["What?", "Ross..."], "c13": ["You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?", "I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.", "Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.

Last night was just wonderful.", "I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.", "Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye."], "c07": ["Hi!", "Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.", "No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.", "Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!", "Yeah?", "Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a cafe, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.", "Oh... Bye guys."], "c09": ["Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!", "Oh my God!", "Hi! Oh my gosh!", "Oh.", "What... What...", "Aw..", "Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.", "Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.", "Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.", "I will.

I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.", "Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.", "I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.", "Well...", "Wait, what are you doing?", "Could I get some peanuts?", "This is ridiculous! I...", "Yeah, okay."], "c08": ["Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?", "What? What? Ross, you're scaring me.
