Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!", "u026": "Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.", "u028": "So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a...a two month anniversary present.", "u030": "Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!", "u034": "Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?"}, "c10": {"u003": "Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.", "u005": "My husband.", "u007": "She's a stripper.", "u009": "Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?", "u011": "Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?"}, "c11": {"u027": "She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a... Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone."}, "c14": {"u002": "I swear I didn't know she was a hooker! I mean wh-Did you let her smoke in here?", "u004": "Y'know what? I'm gonna make this up to you.

I think I'll take them off.", "u011": "Gotcha sailor."}}, "e09": {"c01": {"u010": "Oh good you're all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?", "u012": "He was in Ross's class...marching band...kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.", "u014": "No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time... Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here.", "u016": "Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler.", "u018": "All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.", "u020": "Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey...", "u024": "All right! Okay, it's just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.", "u028": "Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.", "u030": "All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just-there's gonna be a ton left over.", "u032": "All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?"}, "c02": {"u002": "Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table?

Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?", "u010": "I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.", "u012": "No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We're not at a barn dance. You've gotta-you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?", "u020": "Is your team winning hon?", "u023": "Oh, I didn't know you liked football.", "u025": "You like Green Bay?", "u028": "Hey!", "u032": "Aww thanks!

Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?", "u014": "Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.", "u031": "You started that?!", "u033": "Everyone at our school heard it!", "u038": "I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.", "u045": "Joey, you don't have to finish that.", "u053": "Oh! Me too!", "u056": "That's not totally true.", "u059": "Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.", "u061": "It's true?!!", "u075": "Didn't she walk with a cane?", "u082": "All right, listen you're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!", "u084": "And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!", "u086": "Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.", "u088": "Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you've been through so much since then. And right now you've got so much more important stuff going on in your life.

I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments.

I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants...", "u011": "They hurt so much!", "u013": "The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!", "u015": "I can't! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!", "u017": "I can't do that either!

Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!", "u012": "Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it.", "u014": "Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on.", "u016": "Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!"}, "c08": {"u003": "Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!", "u005": "Oh no, we can't walk!", "u007": "Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?", "u009": "I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!", "u011": "Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!", "u013": "How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?", "u015": "Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah...Ooh...Oohh...Ohh...Oh God...Ohh...Oh...Ohh...Ohhhh..."}, "c11": {"u003": "Oh wait!

So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.", "u026": "Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!", "u028": "And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!", "u031": "Just a minute!
